Problem:
Your task is write a miniature game :video_game:. The player is in charge of a prototype robot AND-Roid, which is sent into an active minefield. The player's task is to direct the robot with up/down/left/right commands safely through the minefield to the exit, without striking any mines.
The game map is provided here.
Map key:
- R Robot start position
- \+ Wall (impassable)
- \# Empty space (passable)
- ^ Mine
- E Exit


It's expected that your game will display the map and exit to the player, but obviously not the locations of the mines.
The winning solution (in any format/language) will be the one which is the best presented, with extra kudos given for going "above and beyond" the basic requirements.
Submission:
When you're confident that you have a working solution, submit a link to your source code repo using the /submit command. If the command returns an error, give it another try in 10 seconds - this is a known issue. Submission closes 16th September 12pm noon.
Be careful out there :bomb: (edited)
