<br/>Simon Radevin, of whom I had 
<br/>lost sight for fifteen years. At
<br/>one time he was my most intimate
<br/>friend, the friend who knows 
<br/>one's thoughts, with whom one 
<br/>passes long, quiet, happy 
<br/>evenings, to whom one tells 
<br/>one's secret love affairs, and 
<br/>who seems to draw out those 
<br/>rare, ingenious, delicate 
<br/>thoughts born of that sympathy 
<br/>that gives a sense of repose. 
<br/>For years we had scarcely been 
<br/>separated; we had lived, 
<br/>travelled, thought and dreamed 
<br/>together; had liked the same 
<br/>things, had admired the same 
<br/>books, understood the same 
<br/>authors, trembled with the same 
<br/>sensations, and very often 
<br/>laughed at the same individuals,
<br/>whom we understood completely by
<br/>merely exchanging a glance. Then
<br/>he married. He married, quite 
<br/>suddenly, a little girl from the
<br/>provinces, who had come to Paris
<br/>in search of a husband. How in 
<br/>the world could that little 
<br/>thin, insipidly fair girl, with 
<br/>her weak hands, her light, 
<br/>vacant eyes, and her clear, 
<br/>silly voice, who was exactly 
<br/>like a hundred thousand 
<br/>marriageable dolls, have picked 
<br/>up that intelligent, clever 
<br/>young fellow? Can any one 
<br/>understand these things? No 
<br/>doubt he had hoped for 
<br/>happiness, simple, quiet and 
<br/>long-enduring happiness, in the 
<br/>arms of a good, tender and 
<br/>faithful woman; he had seen all 
<br/>that in the transparent looks of
<br/>that schoolgirl with light hair.
<br/>He had not dreamed of the fact 
<br/>that an active, living and 
<br/>vibrating man grows weary of 
<br/>everything as soon as he 
<br/>understands the stupid reality, 
<br/>unless, indeed, he becomes so 
<br/>brutalized that he understands 
<br/>nothing whatever. What would he 
<br/>be like when I met him again? 
<br/>Still lively, witty, light- 
<br/>hearted and enthusiastic, or in 
<br/>a state of mental torpor induced
<br/>by provincial life? A man may 
<br/>change greatly in the course of 
<br/>fifteen years! The train stopped
<br/>at a small station, and as I got
<br/>out of the carriage, a stout, a 
<br/>very stout man with red cheeks 
<br/>and a big stomach rushed up to 
<br/>me with open arms, exclaiming: 
<br/>"George!" I embraced him, but I 
<br/>had not recognized him, and then
<br/>I said, in astonishment: "By 
<br/>Jove! You have not grown thin!" 
<br/>And he replied with a laugh: 
<br/>"What did you expect? Good 
<br/>living, a good table and good 
<br/>nights! Eating and sleeping, 
<br/>that is my existence!" I looked 
<br/>at him closely, trying to 
<br/>discover in that broad face the 
<br/>features I held so dear. His 
<br/>eyes alone had not changed, but 
<br/>I no longer saw the same 
<br/>expression in them, and I said 
<br/>to myself: "If the expression be
<br/>the reflection of the mind, the 
<br/>thoughts in that head are not 
<br/>what they used to be formerly; 
<br/>those thoughts which I knew so 
<br/>well." Yet his eyes were bright,
<br/>full of happiness and 
<br/>friendship, but they had not 
<br/>that clear, intelligent 
<br/>expression which shows as much 
<br/>as words the brightness of the 
<br/>intellect. Suddenly he said: 
<br/>"Here are my two eldest 
<br/>children." A girl of fourteen, 
<br/>who was almost a woman, and a 
<br/>boy of thirteen, in the dress of
<br/>a boy from a Lycee, came forward
<br/>in a hesitating and awkward 
<br/>manner, and I said in a low 
<br/>voice: "Are they yours?" "Of 
<br/>course they are," he replied, 
<br/>laughing. "How many have you?" 
<br/>"Five! There are three more at 
<br/>home." He said this in a proud, 
<br/>self-satisfied, almost 
<br/>triumphant manner, and I felt 
<br/>profound pity, mingled with a 
<br/>feeling of vague contempt, for 
<br/>this vainglorious and simple 
<br/>reproducer of his species. I got
<br/>into a carriage which he drove 
<br/>himself, and we set off through 
<br/>the town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy
<br/>town where nothing was moving in
<br/>the streets except a few dogs 
<br/>and two or three maidservants. 
<br/>Here and there a shopkeeper, 
<br/>standing at his door, took off 
<br/>his hat, and Simon returned his 
<br/>salute and told me the man's 
<br/>name; no doubt to show me that 
<br/>he knew all the inhabitants 
<br/>personally, and the thought 
<br/>struck me that he was thinking 
<br/>of becoming a candidate for the 
<br/>Chamber of Deputies, that dream 
<br/>of all those who bury themselves
<br/>in the provinces. We were soon 
<br/>out of the town, and the 
<br/>carriage turned into a garden 
<br/>that was an imitation of a park,
<br/>and stopped in front of a 
<br/>turreted house, which tried to 
<br/>look like a chateau. "That is my
<br/>den," said Simon, so that I 
<br/>might compliment him on it. "It 
<br/>is charming," I replied. A lady 
<br/>appeared on the steps, dressed 
<br/>for company, and with company 
<br/>phrases all ready prepared. She 
<br/>was no longer the light-haired, 
<br/>insipid girl I had seen in 
<br/>church fifteen years previously,
<br/>but a stout lady in curls and 
<br/>flounces, one of those ladies of
<br/>uncertain age, without 
<br/>intellect, without any of those 
<br/>things that go to make a woman. 
<br/>In short, she was a mother, a 
<br/>stout, commonplace mother, a 
<br/>human breeding machine which 
<br/>procreates without any other 
<br/>preoccupation but her children 
<br/>and her cook-book. She welcomed 
<br/>me, and I went into the hall, 
<br/>where three children, ranged 
<br/>according to their height, 
<br/>seemed set out for review, like 
<br/>firemen before a mayor, and I 
<br/>said: "Ah! ah! so there are the 
<br/>others?" Simon, radiant with 
<br/>pleasure, introduced them: 
<br/>"Jean, Sophie and Gontran." The 
<br/>door of the drawing-room was 
<br/>open. I went in, and in the 
<br/>depths of an easy-chair, I saw 
<br/>something trembling, a man, an 
<br/>old, paralyzed man. Madame 
<br/>Radevin came forward and said: 
<br/>"This is my grandfather, 
<br/>monsieur; he is eighty-seven." 
<br/>And then she shouted into the 
<br/>shaking old man's ears: "This is
<br/>a friend of Simon's, papa." The 
<br/>old gentleman tried to say 
<br/>"good-day" to me, and he 
<br/>muttered: "Oua, oua, oua," and 
<br/>waved his hand, and I took a 
<br/>seat saying: "You are very kind,
<br/>monsieur." Simon had just come 
<br/>in, and he said with a laugh: 
<br/>"So! You have made grandpapa's 
<br/>acquaintance. He is a treasure, 
<br/>that old man; he is the delight 
<br/>of the children. But he is so 
<br/>greedy that he almost kills 
<br/>himself at every meal; you have 
<br/>no idea what he would eat if he 
<br/>were allowed to do as he 
<br/>pleased. But you will see, you 
<br/>will see. He looks at all the 
<br/>sweets as if they were so many 
<br/>girls. You never saw anything so
<br/>funny; you will see presently." 
<br/>I was then shown to my room, to 
<br/>change my dress for dinner, and 
<br/>hearing a great clatter behind 
<br/>me on the stairs, I turned round
<br/>and saw that all the children 
<br/>were following me behind their 
<br/>father; to do me honor, no 
<br/>doubt. My windows looked out 
<br/>across a dreary, interminable 
<br/>plain, an ocean of grass, of 
<br/>wheat and of oats, without a 
<br/>clump of trees or any rising 
<br/>ground, a striking and 
<br/>melancholy picture of the life 
<br/>which they must be leading in 
<br/>that house. A bell rang; it was 
<br/>for dinner, and I went 
<br/>downstairs. Madame Radevin took 
<br/>my arm in a ceremonious manner, 
<br/>and we passed into the dining-
<br/>room. A footman wheeled in the 
<br/>old man in his armchair. He gave
<br/>a greedy and curious look at the
<br/>dessert, as he turned his 
<br/>shaking head with difficulty 
<br/>from one dish to the other. 
<br/>Simon rubbed his hands: "You 
<br/>will be amused," he said; and 
<br/>all the children understanding 
<br/>that I was going to be indulged 
<br/>with the sight of their greedy 
<br/>grandfather, began to laugh, 
<br/>while their mother merely smiled
<br/>and shrugged her shoulders, and 
<br/>Simon, making a speaking trumpet
<br/>of his hands, shouted at the old
<br/>man: "This evening there is 
<br/>sweet creamed rice!" The 
<br/>wrinkled face of the grandfather
<br/>brightened, and he trembled more
<br/>violently, from head to foot, 
<br/>showing that he had understood 
<br/>and was very pleased. The dinner
<br/>began. "Just look!" Simon 
<br/>whispered. The old man did not 
<br/>like the soup, and refused to 
<br/>eat it; but he was obliged to do
<br/>it for the good of his health, 
<br/>and the footman forced the spoon
<br/>into his mouth, while the old 
<br/>man blew so energetically, so as
<br/>not to swallow the soup, that it
<br/>was scattered like a spray all 
<br/>over the table and over his 
<br/>neighbors. The children writhed 
<br/>with laughter at the spectacle, 
<br/>while their father, who was also
<br/>amused, said: "Is not the old 
<br/>man comical?" During the whole 
<br/>meal they were taken up solely 
<br/>with him. He devoured the dishes
<br/>on the table with his eyes, and 
<br/>tried to seize them and pull 
<br/>them over to him with his 
<br/>trembling hands. They put them 
<br/>almost within his reach, to see 
<br/>his useless efforts, his 
<br/>trembling clutches at them, the 
<br/>piteous appeal of his whole 
<br/>nature, of his eyes, of his 
<br/>mouth and of his nose as he 
<br/>smelt them, and he slobbered on 
<br/>his table napkin with eagerness,
<br/>while uttering inarticulate 
<br/>grunts. And the whole family was
<br/>highly amused at this horrible 
<br/>and grotesque scene. Then they 
<br/>put a tiny morsel on his plate, 
<br/>and he ate with feverish 
<br/>gluttony, in order to get 
<br/>something more as soon as 
<br/>possible, and when the sweetened
<br/>rice was brought in, he nearly 
<br/>had a fit, and groaned with 
<br/>greediness, and Gontran called 
<br/>out to him: "You have eaten too 
<br/>much already; you can have no 
<br/>more." And they pretended not to
<br/>give him any. Then he began to 
<br/>cry; he cried and trembled more 
<br/>violently than ever, while all 
<br/>the children laughed. At last, 
<br/>however, they gave him his 
<br/>helping, a very small piece; and
<br/>as he ate the first mouthful, he
<br/>made a comical noise in his 
<br/>throat, and a movement with his 
<br/>neck as ducks do when they 
<br/>swallow too large a morsel, and 
<br/>when he had swallowed it, he 
<br/>began to stamp his feet, so as 
<br/>to get more. I was seized with 
<br/>pity for this saddening and 
<br/>ridiculous Tantalus, and 
<br/>interposed on his behalf: "Come,
<br/>give him a little more rice!" 
<br/>But Simon replied: "Oh! no, my 
<br/>dear fellow, if he were to eat 
<br/>too much, it would harm him, at 
<br/>his age." I held my tongue, and 
<br/>thought over those words. Oh, 
<br/>ethics! Oh, logic! Oh, wisdom! 
<br/>At his age! So they deprived him
<br/>of his only remaining pleasure 
<br/>out of regard for his health! 
<br/>His health! What would he do 
<br/>with it, inert and trembling 
<br/>wreck that he was? They were 
<br/>taking care of his life, so they
<br/>said. His life? How many days? 
<br/>Ten, twenty, fifty, or a 
<br/>hundred? Why? For his own sake? 
<br/>Or to preserve for some time 
<br/>longer the spectacle of his 
<br/>impotent greediness in the 
<br/>family. There was nothing left 
<br/>for him to do in this life, 
<br/>nothing whatever. He had one 
<br/>single wish left, one sole 
<br/>pleasure; why not grant him that
<br/>last solace until he died? After
<br/>we had played cards for a long 
<br/>time, I went up to my room and 
<br/>to bed; I was low-spirited and 
<br/>sad, sad, sad! and I sat at my 
<br/>window. Not a sound could be 
<br/>heard outside but the beautiful 
<br/>warbling of a bird in a tree, 
<br/>somewhere in the distance. No 
<br/>doubt the bird was singing in a 
<br/>low voice during the night, to 
<br/>lull his mate, who was asleep on
<br/>her eggs. And I thought of my 
<br/>poor friend's five children, and
<br/>pictured him to myself, snoring 
<br/>by the side of his wife.
